Development Exercise

  Please create a branch of this repository to complete your task. Name the branch whatever you like. When complete, open a Pull Request back to the master branch of this repository.
  
  The following code is poorly designed and error prone. Refactor the objects below to follow a more SOLID design.
  Keep in mind the fundamentals of MVVM/MVC and Single-responsibility when refactoring.

  Further, the refactored code should be flexible enough to easily allow the addition of different display
    methods, as well as additional read and write methods.

  Feel free to add as many additional classes and interfaces as you see fit.

  Note: The goal here is not 100% correctness, but instead a glimpse into how you
    approach refactoring/redesigning bad code. Commit often to your branch.



    Task Completed. Thank you for this opportunity.

    1. I have not changed the original interface.
    2. Index.php is the entry point.
    3. PlayersObject uses Helper class present in data folder to read and write in different sources.
    4. It uses Format class in dataFormat folder to display contents according to the given format.


PS. I forgot to create a new Branch after Forking.
